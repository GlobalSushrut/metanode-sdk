# Final Publishing Steps for MetaNode SDK

Great progress! Both the Python and npm packages are ready for publishing. We've:
1. Successfully pushed all code to GitHub
2. Created version tag v1.1.0
3. Built the Python package with the correct PyPI classifier
4. Set up webpack and built the npm package

## Remaining Steps

### 1. Publish to PyPI
```bash
# Ensure you're in the SDK directory
cd /home/umesh/Videos/vKuber9/metanode-sdk

# Upload to PyPI (you'll need PyPI credentials)
python3 -m twine upload dist/*

# If not already registered on PyPI:
# 1. Create an account at https://pypi.org/account/register/
# 2. Create an API token at https://pypi.org/manage/account/token/
```

### 2. Publish to npm
```bash
# Log in to npm
npm login

# Once logged in, publish the package
npm publish
```

### 3. Verify Installations

After publishing, verify that your packages can be installed:

```bash
# Python package
pip install metanode-sdk

# npm package
npm install metanode-sdk
```

### 4. GitHub Actions Automation

For future releases, set up your GitHub repository with these secrets:
- `PYPI_USERNAME` and `PYPI_PASSWORD` (or `PYPI_API_TOKEN`) for PyPI publishing
- `NPM_TOKEN` for npm publishing

These will enable automated publishing through the configured GitHub Actions workflow whenever you push a new version tag.

## What's Already Done

✅ GitHub repository at: https://github.com/GlobalSushrut/metanode-sdk.git
✅ Version tag v1.1.0 created and pushed
✅ Python package built successfully
✅ npm package built successfully with webpack
✅ All documentation in place

## Post-Publishing Tasks

1. Update any documentation links with the actual PyPI and npm package URLs
2. Announce the availability of the SDK through appropriate channels
3. Consider creating a getting started tutorial to help users with first-time setup
4. Set up issue templates in GitHub for feature requests and bug reports
